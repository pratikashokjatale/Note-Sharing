  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
  <p>The basic concept of this app is to allow user to add multiple note, these notes is then saved in JavaScript LocalStorage, user can get recent note from the LocalStorage. I have also added some additional function to prevent user from refreshing page since this a note app, but if user does force refresh on page, then your note is note gone but the created element that was appended is now gone since no function or value was added on the input so your created element does not read those again since as default your input value is <b>null</b> If you wanna know more on how I cam up with this idea and more about the concept of this app you can visit my website, link is my github profile, Thanks for reading and have a nice day ðŸ˜‰</p>
